## 1. System Overview & Product Truth Classification

Aura & Grid is a curated digital showroom and software asset dealership paired with GhostFactoryOS, a private digital manufacturing command center.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **PRODUCT TRUTH & REGULATORY DISCLOSURE:**
> All digital vehicles, consoles, and web applications cataloged within this repository are **Simulations, Interactive Prototypes, and Deployable Source Blueprints**.
> - **Non-Production Status:** None of the assets represent live, flight-certified, space-qualified, or safety-certified operational systems.
> - **Simulated Telemetry:** All SCADA, orbital mechanics, industrial sensor feeds, clinical trial data, and financial records utilize mathematical simulation engines and deterministic mock states.
> - **Regulatory Exclusions:** These assets do not constitute legal, medical, financial, or engineering compliance certifications. Production deployment requires customer-specific backend configuration, regulatory auditing, and independent security hardening.

## 2. Architecture & Separation of Concerns

The repository enforces a strict two-faced architecture:
1. **Public Showroom (`site/`):** Decoupled, read-only static showroom for interactive test drives, tier-1 license previews, and technical briefs. Zero privileged factory credentials or passkeys are bundled in the public showroom bundle.
2. **Private Command Center (`tools/ghost-factory-console/`):** React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS executive console (`ghost-factory-console`) providing ledger analytics, fleet valuation stress testing, maintenance bays, and deal room management.

## 3. NIST SP 800-218 (SSDF) Supply Chain Compliance

To ensure secure software development practices under NIST SP 800-218:
- **Protect Software (PS):** All sensitive environment variables (`.env`, `.env.local`) are strictly excluded from version control via `.gitignore`. Template credentials are documented exclusively in sanitized `.env.example` files.
- **Produce Well-Secured Software (PW):** Zero hardcoded API tokens or service keys reside in source code. Code replacement and formatting are strictly tracked and audited.
- **Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV):** Continuous `npm audit` verification enforces 0 Critical CVEs across the dependency tree.
