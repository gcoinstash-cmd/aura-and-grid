## 3. TRADE-DRESS & ARCHITECTURAL NOVELTY DECLARATION
The ApexLimit Engine features three proprietary structural innovations designed to withstand IP challenges and support design/utility patent filings:
1. **Scaled-Integer Atomic Memory Matching Ring:** Complete elimination of floating-point arithmetic across both order book queues and margin reservation logic, preventing IEEE-754 mantissa drift.
2. **O(1) Direct Hash-to-Queue Cancellation Topology:** High-speed order cancellation that avoids linear queue scans by maintaining a bidirectional mapping between order UUID and internal FIFO doubly-linked nodes.
3. **Integrated Sub-Millisecond Liquidation Sentinel:** Dynamic margin calculation with haircuts evaluated synchronously prior to order execution and triggered on top-of-book depth breaches.

## 4. IP TRANSFER & WARRANTY AFFIDAVIT
Upon execution of the corresponding Asset Purchase Agreement and receipt of the negotiated consideration ($75,000–$150,000 USD), 100% of the worldwide rights, title, copyright, trade secrets, and patentable subject matter in GF-T3-151 shall transfer to the Purchaser free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and third-party claims.
