### 1. CLEAN-ROOM METHODOLOGY & ORIGIN CERTIFICATION
This certification confirms that the codebase, mathematical formulations, and software components comprising **GF-T3-156 (AeroKinetic Engine)** were authored from scratch under strict clean-room engineering protocols.

1. **Independent Authoring:** All code in `src/core/ekf_engine.py`, API specs, and schemas was developed without access to proprietary, copyrighted, or patent-encumbered third-party guidance software (e.g., PX4, ArduPilot, ROS GPL packages).
2. **Academic & Public Domain Grounding:** All mathematical equations and Lie group kinematic formulations are derived from unencumbered peer-reviewed publications:
   - *Joan Solà (2017)*, "Quaternion kinematics for the error-state Kalman filter", arXiv:1711.02508 (Open Access).
   - *R. E. Kalman (1960)*, "A New Approach to Linear Filtering and Prediction Problems", Journal of Basic Engineering.
   - *Peter D. Joseph (1968)*, Covariance stabilization formulations (Public Domain).
3. **Absence of Copyleft Code:** No source code, snippets, or binary artifacts originating from GNU General Public License (GPL v1/v2/v3), Affero GPL (AGPL), Server Side Public License (SSPL), or Common Public Attribution License (CPAL) have entered the repository.
