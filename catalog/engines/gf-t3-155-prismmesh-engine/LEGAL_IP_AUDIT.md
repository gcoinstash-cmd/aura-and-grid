# LEGAL IP AUDIT & CLEAN-ROOM CERTIFICATION
## GF-T3-155: PrismMesh PBS MEV Auction & Deterministic Sequencing Core
**Audit Date**: October 2026  
**Auditor**: Ghost FactoryOS Systems Architecture & Legal IP Group  
**Target Valuation**: $125,000 USD (Standalone Asset Purchase Agreement)

## 1. CLEAN-ROOM DEVELOPMENT AFFIDAVIT
The software artifact codenamed **PrismMesh Engine** (Asset ID: `GF-T3-155`) was designed, engineered, and synthesized strictly in a clean-room architectural cleanroom without ingestion, decompilation, reverse-engineering, or copyright contamination from proprietary or copyleft codebases (specifically excluding all versions of Flashbots `mev-boost`, `builder-solana`, or Jito-Solana copyleft implementations).

### Architectural Novelty
1. **Deterministic Multi-Key State Collision DAG**: Novel topological sort algorithm with Bernstein condition checks for high-density transactional packing.
2. **Revert Insulation Boundary**: Zero-gas drop guarantees insulating block space from malicious reverting bundle spam.
3. **Sealed-Bid Cryptographic Hash Commitment**: Anti-front-running mechanism preventing relay snooping.

## 3. NON-INFRINGEMENT & FREEDOM-TO-OPERATE OPINION
A comprehensive patent search was conducted covering algorithmic transaction bundle ordering and proposer-builder separation protocols. The state conflict DAG sorting mechanism operates purely on mathematical set-intersection invariants in user-space memory, constituting an unencumbered computational process.
