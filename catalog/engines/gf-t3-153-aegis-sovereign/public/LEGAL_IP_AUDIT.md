## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
GF-T3-153 (AegisSovereign Engine) has undergone a formal clean-room intellectual property audit. The codebase comprises an original, independent implementation of the Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold (FROST) protocol (RFC 9380 standard) and an atomic 2-Phase Commit Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) financial settlement engine.

All code, data structures, cryptographic algorithms, state machines, and documentation have been authored from first principles in a sterile clean-room environment. No proprietary, copyleft (GPL, AGPL, SSPL), or confidential third-party codebases were utilized or referenced during development.

## 3. NON-INFRINGEMENT & PATENT CLEARANCE WARRANTY
1. **Mathematical Public Domain Status:** The underlying mathematical foundations—Shamir's Secret Sharing (1979), Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (1987), Schnorr Digital Signatures (expired patent EP0452616), and the FROST RFC 9380 specification—are established public domain cryptographic standards.
2. **Trade Dress & Novelty Protection:** The UI HUD visual telemetry architecture, 2PC pipe synchronization layout, and atomic consensus cockpit represent original trade dress developed under Ghost FactoryOS design principles.
3. **Clean-Room Development Certificate:** The authoring engineers have executed binding clean-room covenants certifying that no source code, trade secrets, or confidential IP of previous employers, custody vendors (e.g., Fireblocks, Copper, Qredo), or academic research institutes was incorporated into GF-T3-153.
